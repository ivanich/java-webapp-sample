###Java Webapp Sample with 2 Servers (ExtJS, Spring MVC, and Hibernate)###
This project contains a sample Java web application. The focus for this sample is to create an easy
to follow example that leverages ExtJS for the GUI, Spring MVC for server-side business logic and RESTful 
service routing, and Hibernate for relational mapping. For simplicity the Hibernate persistence layer
uses Hypersonic for in memory persistence, but should be easily swapped out with a full relational database.
